fastmail-contactset
===================

1. Deletes all contacts in a Fastmail address book, up to 500 total
2. Imports contacts to Fastmail from a file you specify

As of October, 2014, Fastmail supports IMAP, WebDAV, and CalDAV, but not CardDAV. As a result, users are stuck using the (fine, dandy, non-native) Fastmail mobile web app to handle contacts.
